# Discord-Bot
A Discord bot (nicknamed "The Shooter") written in C# using the Discord.NET Unofficial wrapper.  It features basic moderation features, such as channel renaming and kicking/banning.  The name of the bot was based off of the name of the text channel.  No real thought was poured into it.

It's still a work-in-progress and features consistent updates.  After I've finished cleaning up the code and adding more features, I'll publicize the bot more for educational purposes.  I want this bot to be the "unofficial" tutorial bot for C#, mainly for newbies who were introduced to C# through Discord -- so, like myself.  I have to streamline the code and I left it for dead for a long time, but I'm going to begin adding more stuff to it.  Feel free to use it in your server (or not, it's totally fine).

Planning on:
Adding a mathematics module with LaTeX built in.
This module should be able to solve basic mathematics problems.
Streamlining the moderation features.
Streamlining the help/command menu.
Adding a gaming component to it.
(Poker, maybe?)
Adding a music portion to it.

Will add commands/help documentation soon.

*** NOTE***
The Shooter was supposed to primarily be a greeting bot, hence the name of the file Greetings.cs in src/Modules.  Don't let this fool you, however!  Greetings.cs contains moderation features which will assist you in managing your server.  In fact, a future update will feature a separate module altogether.
